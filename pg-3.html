            After the formation of indian national congress in december of 1885. Like other provinces, the then Haryana witnessed a series of oppressive acts by Lord Curzon.

            After the exodus of Lord Curzon, Lord Minto became the new Viceroy of India. During that period, the unrest did notsubside. It increased the economic hardships. The people were already under the impact of natural calamities like famine and the outbreak of dreadful plague. Some legislation like the Punjab Limitation Act, 1904, the Transfer of PropertyAct, 1904 and the Punjab pre-emptions Act, 1905 were passed to weaken the position of money-lenders. The Punjab Land Alienation Act-Amendment Bill, 1906 was a further attempt to place more alienation restrictions. It generated political discontent, especially among the Hindu commercial castes. It was considered by them as an act of great injustice and hardship.

            Lala Lajpat Rai spoke against the oppressive Acts. Consequently, Lala Lajpat Rai and Sardar Ajit Singh were arrested at Lahore and deported without trial in the middle of 1907. The deportation generated a new spirit and agitated the minds of the people of Haryana. This high-handed action on the part of the British Government shook the faith of the people. On account of the arrest of Lala Lajpat Rai, a revolutionary movement began in Haryana. On the suggestion of Morley, Minto released both Lala Lajpat Raiand Ajit Singh on 18th November 1907.
            <br>
            Under the Minto-Morley reforms, as embodied in the Indian Council Act, 1909, the District Boards and other local bodies of the Gurgaon, Rohtak, and Hissar districts were constituted into an electoral unit to elect a member to the Punjab Legislative Council.
            In 1911, Emperor George V made a historic announcement about the transfer of the capital of India from Calcutta to Delhi. Many reasons had been advanced for the transfer of the capital. Calcutta was thought to be geographically ill-adopted.

            The Ist World War broke out in 1914 and India being a part of the British empire was dragged into the war activities. The people of Haryana helped the Government by providing recruits and by contributing money and material. Haryana's contribution to the army personnel was 71,366. The total number of men from the then Gurgaon district who served during World War I (1914-1918) was 20,181, out of which 17,700 were enlisted during the war. The related position of the district in the then province of Punjab in these respects was 9th and 10th, respectively. The district registered 314 fatal casualties. Pataudi; which was then a separate princely state, contributed 450 persons. This was 14.5% of eligible males, which was about the same as in the Gurgaon district (14.2%). The villages, namely Uton, Khandsa, Biser, Akbarpur, and Khotala Serai in the Gurgaon district gave practically every able-bodied man and boy. The people of Ambala helped the Government in its war efforts. The village peasants gave 8,341 recruits to the army. The urban rich contributed to the war loans and funds.
            <br>
            Lord Chelmsford, the Viceroy made a special visit to Rohtak as a mark of appreciation. A total number of 22,144 recruits were taken from the Rohtak district which topped the list.
            During 1917-18, the Congress party began to gain some footing. In 1917 the Congress Party Committee was established at Rohtak. Chaudhry Chhotu Ram and Babu Shyam Lal were its president and secretary, respectively. In 1917, at the Calcutta session of Congress five persons of Rohtak represented the district.
            In 1918, the Congress session was held at Delhi under the presidentship of pt. Madan Mohan Malaviya. Pt. Neki Ram Sharma and Chaudhry Peeru Singh and Lala Daulat Ram participated in this session.
            During the year of 1919, there blew a wave of unrest and distrust. The people had ungrudgingly brooked all types of tribulations and miseries during the Ist World War and made common cause with the British. These factors coupled with the tall promises made by the British had roused high expectations.

             The year 1919 was an important landmark in the history ofIndia's struggle for freedom.
             After the passage of the Rowlatt Bill, the people of Ambala district also rose against the Government. Hartals were observed in every town, processions were taken out and meetings were held in opposition of the Act from March, 1919 to the end of April.
             <br>
             The people were called upon to disobey the repressive laws by non-violent methods. Mahatma Gandhi declared `March 30, 1919' as the day of hartal all over India (postponed to April 6). The whole of the Haryana State responded to the call of hartal.
             The hartal was observed at Rewari on March 30, 1919.
             At Palwal a complete hartal was observed on April 6. Hartal was renewed at Palwal on that day (April 10) and continued for 3 days.
             At Hodal a meeting was organized on April 11 and hartal was observed on the same day.

             Partial hartal was also observed at Gurgaon on April 10.

             In Punjab the educated classes were disturbed due to Dwyer's
             stringent actions and his inflammatory speeches. Sir Michal

            were discontented. On 13th April, 1919 the cold-blooded
            massacre took place at Jallianwala Bagh at Amritsar. Like the
            towns of Punjab, a number of violent incident took place at
            Ambala, Karnal and Rohtak.

            During 1930, the Fourth Reformed Council was formed by
            the participation of Unionist Party, Hindu Mahasabha and the
            Congress Party. Out of the 9 seats from Haryana region, 4
            seats were won by the Congress Party. These constituencies
            were: Ambala, Karnal and two candidates from Hissar.

            In September 1939, the Second World War broke out. Lord
            Linlithgo, the Viceroy of India, also declared war and sent
            Indian troops abroad. While in the Ist World War, all the
            people helped the Government with men and materials, but
            this time the public opinion was different. The Congress
            party refused to cooperate with the Government of India on
            account of dragging India into war without consulting her.
            The Congress withdrew its members from the Central
            Legislature. All the Congress provincial ministers resigned.
            <br>
            The Congress Working Committee urged the British
            Government for the declaration of India's independence. The
            demand was repeated when the Congress Working
            Committee met again in Delhi in July 1940.As the crisis deepened Sir Stafford Cripps arrived in Delhi on
            March 23, 1942, with the British cabinet proposals. Gandhi Ji
            held talks with him on March 27 and found little hope for
            the settlement left Delhi on April 4. The Congress Working Committee passed the 'Quit India'
            resolution at Wardha on 14th July 1942. The All India
            Congress Committee met again in Bombay on 7th August,
            1942 to consider the resolution.

            The battle of Indian freedom had reached its final stage.
            There seemed to be a lull, but no one could imagine the
            velocity with which the storm would rage.On the night of 8th
            August,1942, the British Goverment arrested Gandhi ji and
            members of Congress Working Committee and removed to
            somewhere in India.
            The arrest of Gandhi ji in August, 1942 was followed by
            hartals and processions in nearly the whole of the Rohtak-
            Sonipat area.
            The District Congress Committee, Rohtak, unanimously
            supported the Quit India Movement (resolution) adopted by
            the Congress in 1942. The people of this district enraged at
            the arrest of the leaders.
            the Congress Organization was
            declared unlawful in Ambala district. Its leaders were
            arrested.
            <br><br>
            The leading persons of the then Karnal district, unanimously
            approved the 'Quit India' resolution adopted by the District
            Congress Committee, Karnal. The declaration of the
            Congress Committee as unlawful led to a sharp reaction.
            There was explosion at the Karnal Post-office aimed at setting fire to the dak. The
            distillery was set on fire at several places; Government
            buildings were damaged. In Hissar district also people rose in revolt at the call of the
            Congress Committee. Telephone wires were cut and railway
            lines were dislocated. The Congress Working Committee passed the 'Quit India'
            resolution at Wardha on 14th July 1942. The All India
            Congress Committee met again in Bombay on 7th August,
            1942 to consider the resolution.
            <br>
            The elections to the Central and Provincial legislatures were held in December, 1945. The main parties were the Congress Party, the Unionist and Muslim league.
            In the election Muslim League secured highest seats, i.e. 75 (from Punjab region 69 and from Haryana area-6). The Congress Party got 51 seats(from Punjab region 40 and from Haryana region 11). The Akalis stood at the third ladder by winning 22 seats from Punjab area. The Unionist bagged 16 seats from Punjab region and 4 from Haryana region. The Independents (7) got their entry in the legislature.
            <br>
            The Crips Mission (March-April,1942) ended as a complete failure. Throughout these negotiations, Congress could not count on the support of the Muslim League.
            On 6th May, 1944, Gandhi ji was released from prison on the grounds of health. Lord Wavell, who succeeded Lord Linlithgo as Governor-General flew to London in March 1945 and came back with the proposals. He summoned a conference at Simla on 25 June 1945 to execute the action over the proposals but it broke down as the Congress and the Muslim League could not agree.
            <br>
            A new and dynamic factor was introduced when Lord Mountbatten succeeded Lord Wavell on March 24, 1947 to implement Atlee's assurance that independence would be granted to India by date not later than, June, 1948.
            Freedom and Partition came hand in hand in August 1947. At the last stroke of mid-night August 14, the members of the Constituent Assembly pledged themselves to the service of the nation "to the end that this ancient land shall attain her rightful place in the world and mark her full and willing contribution to the promotion of world peace and welfare of mankind." Thus India and Pakistan became Independent nations on August 15, 1947.

            After the migration of the population from Pakistan to India the Government had to face a lot of hardships in establishing them here. Their immediate location in a large number of camps and eventual rehabilitation in rural and urban areas created numerous problems which the Government faced with courage. According to the 1951 Census, the then Karnal district alone absorbed 2,50,471 of which 1,32,709 persons settled in rural areas and the remaining 1,17,762 in urban areas.

            The people of Haryana are very famous for their heroic qualities. They always remain ready to sacrifice their lives for the sake of the country. They also showed unflinching loyalty towards the country when China made the attack in 1962 and Pakistan's aggression came in 1965. A large number of people were awarded Paramvir-Chakara and Vir Chakara during hostilities.

            On September 25, 1965, the Government of India appointed a parliamentary committee under the chairmanship of Sardar Hukam Singh, Speaker of Lok-Sabha, to study the question of the division of Punjab. The committee submitted its report on March 18, 1966.
            The Government of India accepted most of its recommendations and set up Shah Commission popularly known as the 'Punjab boundary Commission' to settle the boundaries of new states. The Punjab Reorganization Bill was passed by the Parliament on 10th September 1966. Thus, Haryana as the seventeenth state of India came into existence.
            <br>
            After becoming a separate state, some more districts were made to increase development activities. As on March 31, 1991, there were 16 districts in Haryana and several tahsils and blocks. By the end of December 2001, there were 4 divisions; 19 districts; 47 sub-divisions; 67 tahsils; 45 sub-tahsils, and 116 blocks.

            Now Haryana State is making stellar progress under the leadership of its representatives. It is known as a bowl of rice and a white revolution has ushered. The people of Haryana are maintaining communal harmony, moral standard, and tradition of going armed forces.
