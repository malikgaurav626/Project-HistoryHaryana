The Mehrauli pillar Inscription recounting Chandra's (Vikramaditayas) expedition to the Punjab and Bactria and the recovery of plenty of his silver coins all over eastern Punjab seem to confirm it.

            The region was, however, lost to the Guptas much before Skandagupta's accession possibly during the latter part of Kumaragupta's reign, when it succumbed to Huna incursions. However, prince Skandagupta took the challenge and by his courage and heroism suppressed the Hunas before the Gupta year i.e., C.E. 457-58.

            The period of the Gupta empire is often seen as the one of the most brilliant in ancient India’s history.
            The Gupta preside over one of the most productive periods of Indian civilization. Advances are being made in many fields of science, art and literature. Most notably, it is probably about now that Indian mathematicians develop the decimal system of numbers. This system will be crucial to future mathematical and scientific progress in world history.
            The Gupta emperors rule northern India directly, and, through political and family ties with the Vataka in the Deccan, have had great influence in central India as well. By this date, however, both the Guptas’ and the Vakatas’ power is in decline, as fierce invasions by the White Huns from central Asia weaken them, and subordinate kingdoms assert their independence.

            After Skandagupta's death (C.E. 467-68 ) the Hunas under their able commanders, Toramana (C.E. 500-515 ) and Mihirakula (C.E. 515-550 ) had no difficulty in establishing their hold over this region. An inscribed stone seal of Toramana in Brahmi discovered at Sugh and the coins of this ruler along with those of his successor Mihirakula from Ambala probably suggest that some part of the region was conquered by the Hunas.
            During this period of struggle for political power in northern India, there arose a new dynasty founded by Pushpabhuti in Haryana which was then known as Shrikantha Janapada. The early rulers of this dynasty probably served under the Guptas but with changing circumstances, they demonstrated their allegiance also to the Hunas who, as shown earlier, was gaining ascendency in this region.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            The genealogy of the dynasty given in the inscriptions of Harsha is as follows: Narovardhana, Rajyavardhana I, Adityavardhana, Prabhakaravardhana, Rajyavardhana II, and Harshavardhana.
            The first three rulers of the dynasty assumed the title of Maharaja only which indicates their feudatory status. They were probably feudatories of the Hunas, the Guptas, and also the Maukharis at different periods. According to R.C. Majumder, they flourished between A.D. 500-580. Adityavardhana, the third ruler was highly influential, for the queen was the sister of Mahasenagupta, a later-Gupta  ruler of Magadha, who is mentioned in the Harshacharita as a contemporary of both Prabhakaravardhana and Harshavardhana, and whose two princes Madhavagupta and Kumaragupta stayed in the Vardhana court.
            <br>
            Bana's Harshacharita is a valuable source of ancient tradition and a record of contemporary history. It informs that Prabhakaravardhana was also known as Pratapashila who cemented political alliances with his contemporary powers. He embarked on a bold policy that made him the greatest ruler of this part of India, and his name stirred reverential awe in the kingdoms of Huna, Malava, Lata, and Gurjara.

            Haryana seems to have formed a part of the kingdom of Kanauj under Yashovarman (c. C.E. 690-740 ). The poet Vahpatiraja describes the march of his army through Shrikantha and Kurukshetra and places connected with the Bharata war. The same work alludes to his victory over the Arabs in this part of the country. Yashovarman's hold over this region was short-lived for the Rajatarangini informs of his crushing defeat at the hands of Kashmir ruler Lalitaditya Muktapida who established his hold over the region for some time. Later on, Pratihara Vatsaraja(c. C.E. 775-792 ) a ruler of Rajasthan, conquered it from the famous Bhandi clan. Vatsaraja too, like earlier rulers could not keep it under his control for long.
            <br>
            Following his defeat at the hands of the Rashtrakutas in the Ganga Valley, he sought refuge in Rajasthan. Dharmapala of Bengal (C.E. 770-810 ), Pratihara Vatsaraja's rival in the north, seized this opportunity and established his hold over the kingdom of Kanauj. Since a king of the kuru clan was present at Dharmapala's imperial assembly at
            Kanauj, Haryana seems to have continued to owe allegiance to the kingdom of Kanauj.
            <br>
            With the accession of Pratihara Nagabhata II (C.E. 792-833 ), a new era began in this region. From the account of his conquest as furnished by the Gwalior inscription, it appears that his empire had extended far and wide. Further, the Skandapurana informs that Brahmavarta(the region between the Sarasvati and the Drishadvati) was in his possession. According to the Gwalior Inscription which mentions his conquest ofRajagiridurga(identified with Rajarri), it appears that his empire had extended up to Punjab, including, of course, the region of Haryana. Under Mihira Bhoja (A.D.836-890 ) the Pratihara empire extended up to Takkadesha (Southeastern Punjab) in the north. His inscriptions from Pehowa and Sirsa and coins from district Rohtak support his rule over this region.

            Pehowa Inscription of the time of Mahendrapala (C.E. 890-910), the successor of Bhoja gives the genealogy of the Tomara rulers of the Kurukshetra region, who were the feudatories of the Pratiharas.
            <br>
            It may be difficult to establish the relationship of these Tomaras of Haryana with those of Delhi who were defeated later by the Chahamanas of Shakambhari, but given the bardic tradition which associates the Tomaras with Delhi, it is reasonable to believe that the Tomara family of Haryana was connected with the region formerly known as the Delhi
            division of Punjab. This is confirmed by the Palam Baoli Inscription (C.E. 1280) stating that the land of Hariyanaka was first enjoyed
            by the Tomaras and then by the Chahamanas.

            The region was subsequently raided by Mahmud's successors Niyaltigin and Masud in 1034 and 1036 respectively. Masud attacked the fortress of Sirsa. He found the track rich in sugarcane. So his forces filled the moat with sugarcane and stormed the fortress. He next marched to Sonipat and defeated its governor, Dipal Hari. A considerable part of Haryana thus passed on to the Ghaznavid rule. Masud's son, Majdud ruled over this region from his headquarters at Hansi. He refused allegiance to his brother Maudud, the new ruler of Ghazni. Consequently, a struggle for dominance ensued between the two brothers which resulted in the death of Majdud at Lahore in 1041.

            These dissensions among the Ghaznavids and the impending danger of the Seljuq attack on their territory in the west offered an opportunity to the Hindu rulers to unite under the leadership of the Tomara ruler of Delhi. The rulers belonged to the Chahamana, Paramana, and Kalachuri dynasties. They recaptured Hansi, Thanesar, and other dependencies and recovered Haryana from the Ghaznavids. In 1059 with the accession of Ibrahim, the son of Masud I, the region was again raided several times. Similarly, his son Mahmud, the governor of Punjab had also to enter this region following his expeditions to Agra, Kanauj, Kalanjara and
            Ujjain.
            <br>
            This calamity probably compelled the Tomaras to come to terms with the Ghaznavids as indicated in the Parshvanatha-Charita of Shrivara.

            The Tomara rule in Haryana was finally put to an end by the Chahamanas in the first half of the 12th century A.D.
            The Chahamana victory was short-lived because the Tomaras of Haryana continued to fight for their survival until the reign of Vigraharaja IV.
            Delhi had the Tomaras before the Chahamanas took it. Hansi was recaptured by the Tomaras from the Ghaznavids and probably remained with them until its conquest by the Chahamanas.

            The Tomara-Chahamana struggle ended with the capture of Hansi and Delhi by Vigraharaja. The Tomaras were weakened by their continuous struggle against the Muslims and the
            Chahamanas surrendered their independence and became the feudatories of the latter. That Haryana formed a part of the Chahamana Kingdom under Vigraharaja is clear from the Delhi-Siwalik Inscription & on the Ashokan pillar originally found at village Topra(in Ambala District), which Firoz Shah shifted later to Delhi. The inscription dated C.E. 1164 contains a eulogy of the Shakambhari King Visaladeva (Vigraharaja IV), the son of Annalladeva (Arnoraja ), who subdued the whole region from the Vindhyas to the Himalayas and exterminated the mlechchhas.

This Indian state is one of the great empires of world history, with a stability that rests on a tolerance between Muslims and Hindus. This allows members of both faiths to belong to a unified ruling class.

            In the Second Battle of Tarain Indian history took a definite turn. Haryana and Delhi along with the forts of Hansi, Sirsa and Thanesar passed on to the Muslim rule for centuries to come.
            Conditions of Haryana is unavailable for the period ranging from the death of Harsha (A.D. 647-648) to the Second Battle of Tarain (C.E. 1192). The wealth in the temples seems to have attracted the foreign invaders to the region. Only a few vestiges of the temples and sculptural pieces have survived the iconoclastic fury of the invader but they reflect the artistic of the region during the Pratihara-Tomara period.

            Humayun's son Akbar (reigned 1556–1605) is often remembered as the greatest of all Mughal emperors.<br><br>
            In this communalisation of history, Sultan Aurangzeb (1618–1707) bears the dubious distinction of being blamed for the downfall of the mighty Mughal empire due to his intolerance, a product of his puritanical interpretation of religion. 
            <br>
            Many historians blame Aurangzeb's insensitivity towards other religions behind various revolts across the whole region thus resulting in the decline of the authority by the mughal empire.
            With the decline of the Mughal empire, territorial ambitions were let loose. Frequent changes in the ownership of estates were effected either by imperial orders in favour of loyalnobles or were brought about by powerful local parties backing their claims with force.
            <br>
            As a natural sequel to the notorious incapacity of the unworthy descendants of Babur, Akbar and Aurengzeb, and the selfish activities of the nobility, the Mughal State grew corrupt and inefficient. It lost its prestige not only within India but also outside it. The country famous for its riches, which excited the cupidity of external invaders from time immemorial, became exposed to the menace of a foreign invasion,as had been the case during the dismemberment of the Turko-Afghan Sultanate. This time the invader came not from central Asia but from Pursia(Nadir Shah 1738).
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            Ahmad Shah Durrani invaded North India for the fourth time in early 1757. He entered Delhi in January 1757 and kept the Mughal emperor under arrest. On his return in April 1757, Abdali re-installed the Mughal emperor Alamgir II on Delhi throne as a titular head. However, the actual control of Delhi was given to Najib-ud-Daula, who had promised to pay an annual tribute of 20 lakh rupees to Abdali. Najib had also assisted Abdali in his fourth invasion and had already won the trust of the Afghan emperor. It can be said that he worked as the agent of Abdali in Delhi court. So, Najib was now the de facto ruler of Delhi with Alamgir II as a puppet emperor in his control.
            The battle of Delhi in 1757 also referred to as the Second battle of Delhi, was a battle fought on 11 August 1757 between the Maratha Empire and the Rohillas Afghans.
            <br>
            Najib surrendered and 
            The Marathas had now become the de facto rulers of Delhi. Raghunath Rao appointed Antaji Mankeshwar as Governor of Delhi province while Alamgir II was retained as titular head with no actual power.

            The Third Battle of Panipat took place on 14 January 1761 between the Maratha Empire and the invading army of the Durrani Afghan Empire.
            <br>
            Ahmad Shah Durrani retired from Punjab in December 1762. Thereafter, Sikhs appeared on the scene in Karnal, Ambala, and Panipat areas. They defeated and killed Zain Khan, the Durrani Governor of Sirhind, and took possession of the whole of Sirhind province as far south as Panipat.
            The off and on plundering by the Sikhs in the paraganas of Karnal and Panipat continued in the following few years. Najib-ud-daulah fought many battles with them but was defeated in 1768. Later on, taking advantage of the illness of Najib-ud-daulah, the Sikhs launched their raids and arrived near Panipat on 4th January 1770, plundering and ravaging the country as they went. Najib's eldest son, Zabita Khan, tried to oppose them, but he could not carry out his plans properly. The Sikhs plundered every village between Panipat and Delhi.
            On the death of Najib-ud-daulah on October 31, 1770, Zibita Khan succeeded to his estates including the district of Panipat.
            <br>
            In 1774, Gajpat Singh seized Karnal. Shortly afterward Najaf Khan, the Imperial Wazir, marched in person to restore his authority, and by a treaty concluded between the Rajas and the emperor, the Sikhs relinquished their conquests in Karnal and its neighborhood, excepting seven villages, which Gajpat Singh was allowed to keep and which probably included Shera, Majra, Jatan, Dharmgarh, Bal Jatan, and Bala.
            <br>
            Gajpat Singh was recognised as the ruler of Jind area with the title of Maharaja (July 12, 1781), and his tribute was fixed at rupees six lakh. Zabita Khan and Gajpat Singh interviewed the other Sikh chiefs and persuaded them to come to agreement with the Delhi Government. Thus the Mughal emperor of India formally accepted the sovereignty of the Sikhs over the country situated to the Upper Doab.
            <br>
            This peace was, however, short-lived. In 1782, Emperor Shah Alam was forced by circumstances to seek the protection of Mahadaji Sindhia and to appoint him Vakil-i-Mutliq (Regent Plenipotentiary) combining the office of the Wazir and the Commander-in-chief.

            Among the most notorious adventurers in northern India was a foreigner who entitled himself the Raja of Hansi. It was George Thomas, an Irish. The poverty of his parents left him uneducated and compelled him to leave for India to earn his livelihood. He served on a ship as a cabin boy, or as some affirm, a common sailor, and landed at Madras (now Chennai) in 1780. Having spent some years in Karnatak with Poligars, a poor class of chiefs inhabiting the jungle and mountainous districts, he became discontented with his position. Five years later he went to Hyderabad and enlisted in the Nizam's army as a private gunner. He gave up this job six months afterward, and in 1787 walked on foot to Delhi where he sought service under the celebrated Begam Samru, who held the fief of Meerut district.
            he was at once employed by the Begam who was an excellent judge of character. His ability and bravery soon won him the confidence of the Begam. He fell in love with the Begam but soon lost interest in the old lady and found enjoyment with the young beauties in the Begam's large household. The Begam then married him to one of her slave girls named Marie whom she had adopted. The emperor had granted her a jagir on the borders of Delhi on the condition of checking Sikhs. The Begam appointed George Thomas to administer this jagir. He repulsed the Sikh attacks. He was then promoted to the command of a battalion in her army. In 1789 Shah Alam II invested the fort of Gokalgarh, a little to the northwest of the Agra under the charge of Najaf Quli Khan, a rebel courtier of Delhi. Begam Samru with George Thomas was in attendance upon the emperor. One night Najaf Quli attacked the imperial army unexpectedly when they were dissipating themselves in debauch, and defeated it. The emperor would have been taken prisoner if George Thomas had not been there.
            <br>
            Though he was the favourite general of Begum Samru, due to jealous intrigues of his French rival Le Vassoult (committed suicide in 1795) he was supplanted in 1792 in her favour. He then transferred his allegiance to Apa Khande Rao, a Maratha chieftain under Mahadaji Scindia of Gwalior State. He worked for Apa Khande Rao for four years (1793 - 1797) to conquer Haryana by subduing Rajputs of Rajasthan, Kachawa Shekhawat Thakur rulers of Haryana and Shekhawati, Mughals under vizir Mirza Najaf Khan and Bhatti Muslim Rajputs.
            <br>
            On the death of his patron Apa Khande Rao in 1797, Thomas declared independence from the Marathas. He quickly took possession of Rohtak and Hisar and made Hansi his capital. Later that year his requests to the Chiefs of the Phulkian Misl for assistance against the Marathas were rejected. He thereafter launched a campaign against Jind whilst the Phulkian Chief was in Lahore. Despite lifting his siege of Jind, Thomas, and his forces were forced to flee from Sikh forces during a night attack, forcing Thomas to sue for peace. The peace only lasted until 1799, when the Phulkian Misl launched further expeditions against neighboring Jind and Kythal and decimated portions of Thomas's large army. In January of 1800, he invaded Patiala but was repelled by the Sidhu's of Patiala.

            The year 1803 is an important year in the history of Haryana. In this year, the area of what is now present day Haryana and Delhi came under the control of the East India Company of Great Britain. At that time, Delhi was being ruled by the old and weak Mughal ruler, Shah Alam.
            The establishment of the rule of the East India Company ended the period of anarchy in Haryana. The people of Haryana did not accept the new masters. Consequently, people rose in revolt irrespective of caste and religion against the Britishers.
            Though the British controlled the Delhi territory in 1809-10, yet the opposition did not completely subside. There were many factors which encouraged antagonism between the rulers and the ruled.
            The Bungalia Singh, the chief of Chhachhrauli State died in 1809. Jodh Singh, the chief of Kalsia occupied Chhachhrauli. David Ochterlony opposed his action and demanded his immediate withdrawal, Consequently, Jodh Singh Withdrew his forces in 1810. In 1818 he re-occupied the territory.

            The British authorities sent Brigadier-General Arnold with heavy troops in October, 1818. Meanwhile, Rani Ram Kaur lost the sympathy of her subjects due to her mishandling of the administration. Then Jodh Singh won the sympathy of the people. But Jodh Singh could not retainhis position and had to return back. Thereafter Chhachhrauli State was annexed to the British territory.
            The administration of Jind state was entrusted to prince Fateh Singh. Though Raja Bhag Singh (original ruler of Jind state) did not like this arrangement, yet he did not oppose it. In fact, he had neither the will nor the means to do it. Raja Bhag Singh died in 1819, and Fateh Singh succeeded him. He ruled for a short time only and died three years later (1822). Now Sangat Singh (11 years old) succeeded him.
            He visited Lahore twice in 1826 and 1827 respectively. He was given a number of Jagirs. In 1834, Sangat Singh went to Lahore, which infuriated the British and they censured him for his unauthorized negotiations with Lahore Court. He died suddenly on 2nd November, 1834.

            The bugle of the War of Independence (uprising of 1857) was sounded first by the people of Haryana at Ambala on 10th May, 1857, about nine hours before the outbreak at Meerut. Thus, the whole of the nation was led to revolt against the British by raising the standard of 1857 War of Independence.

            On the 16th September, 1857, Delhi fell. Bahadur Shah with his wife Zinat Mahal and his family (two sons and a grand son) surrendered himself to Capt. Hodson who shot the princes with his own hands and their bodies were thrown on the Chabutaru near Kotwali. The king was tried and sent Rangoon with his family. Hakim Abdul Haqi, one of the foremost leaders of the then Gurgaon district, was executed on November 2, 1857. The Raja of Ballabgarh was hanged on April 21, 1858. Nawab of Farrukhnagar was executed on January 25, 1858.
            The events of 1857 brought the company's rule to an end. India was henceforth to be governed by and in the name ofher majesty. The impact brought by the events of 1857 was direct and indirect.

            Until 1832 the whole area of Haryana including Rohtak was under the Resident at Delhi; but when that year it was brought under the same regulations the rest of North India, the Resident became Commissioner. The Rohtak district was abolished in 1841 A.D. : Gohana going to Panipat, and the rest of tahsils to Delhi, but in the very next year it was created again. The two districts of Rohtak and Jhajjar together with the rest of the Delhi and Hissar divisions were detached from North-Western provinces after 1857 and passed to the Punjab by the Government of India.
            In the sphere of education, Haryana was one of the most backward regions in India. Neither the British nor the private agencies paid attention to the progress of literacy and education. Though the British occupied the Haryana region earlier than Punjab, no progress was made even in the indigenous system of education.
            Like education, the increase in the production of literary works and periodicals in Haryana was very low and slow. The writers like Balmukand Gupta, M.D. Mishra, Bishambar Nath Sharma, Tulsi Ram Denesh, and pt. Baste Ram aroused feelings of patriotism and self-reliance among the masses through their literature and preachings. They also highlighted the evils prevalent in those days.
