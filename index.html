                    Regarding the origin of the name Hariyana (Haryana), there are diverse interpretations. Hariyana is an ancient name. During the olden period, this region was known as Brahmavarta, Aryavarta, and Brahomoupdesa. These names are based on the emergence of Brahama-Lord on the land of Haryana; the abode of Aryas and home of the preachings of Vedic cultures and other rites. According to Professor H.A. Phadke, “with an inter-mingling of various peoples and races, Haryana’s contribution to the making of the composite Indian culture has been remarkable in its way. Quite significantly, the region has been hailed as the matrix of creation and the very heaven on earth.

            "Its other names Bahudhanyaka and Hariyanka suggest abundance of food supply and vegetation". As per the inscription found from Bohar village, Rohtak district, this region was known as Hariyanak. The inscription pertains to the period of Balban during 1337 Vikram Samvat. Later, the word 'Haryana' was inscribed on a stone found during the reign of Sultan Mohammad-bin-Tughlaq. Dharanidhar in his work Akhand Prakash says that “this word comes from Haribanka, connected with the worship of Hari, the Lord Indra. Since the tract is dry one; its people worship Indra (Hari) always for rain”. Another thinker, Girish Chander Avasthi traces its origin from Rigveda where Hariyana is used as a qualifying adjective with the name of a king (Vasuraja). He says, the king ruled over this region and as such the tract came to be known as Hariyana after him.

            Haryana in the sense of geographical unit was not known before the 12th century A.D. Although the term Haryana is of late origin, yet the antiquity of this area has never been questioned. The Tomara Rajputs ruled over 'Hariyana' from Delhi when the Ghaznavids invaded India from the north-west.

            The kingdom of Lahore was annexed by the Ghaznavids in 1020. Sultan Masud, the successor of Sultan Mahmud, in the effort to extend his power, advanced towards Hansi and invested the fort. After the fall of Hansi he marched to Sonipat and defeated its governor, Dipal Hari. While the Tomaras of Delhi succeeded in recovering these territories, they made no attempt to oust Muslims from the kingdom of Lahore. The position, however, changed with the fall of Ghaznavids, when the kingdom of Lahore fell into the hands of Ghuris and the Tomaras of Delhi were overpowered by the Chahamanas. The Chahamanas of Ajmer, after subduing the Tomaras by the middle of the 12th century, soon came face to face with the Ghuris. After taking Lahore in 1186 A.D. :Muhammad Ghuri encountered the Chahamanas under Prithvi Raj. Beaten in his first encounter in 1190-91 at Tarain (Traori) in the Karnal district, he came back the following year to defeat Prithvi Raj in 1192. Prithvi Raj was defeated and taken prisoner or killed in the neighbourhood of the river Saraswati. During this encounter he destroyed the most important town of Meham of Rohtak district. After the battle of Traori in 1192, the Karnal area more or less firmly attached to Delhi. On June 24, 1206, Qutab-ud- din Aibak sat on the throne of Delhi and inaugurated Muslim rule in North India. The Turks of Central Asia, professing the religion of Islam in a fanatic and militant form, became masters of a country, the teeming millions of which believed in diverse cults collectively described as Hinduism. In spite of relentless pressure and ruthless persecutions, a vast majority of people offered an unflinching resistance to the alien conqueror and their creed and showed a dogged persistence in shunning their contacts and maintaining their exclusiveness.

            Even though there is no official map of ancient India and ancient Haryana. But there has been some solid proof that people used to live in the region of Haryana from the late stone age and early iron age, traces of the iron age have been found at places like Panipat, Sonepat, and Mathura in the region of north India.

            An inscription describes Arnoraja as carrying arms into Haritanaka (i.e. Haryana ). The territorial designation Hariala mentioned in the Skandapurana also stands for the same region. The Delhi Museum Inscription of the reign of Muhammad Tughluq (A.D. 1328) gives the name as Hariyana, the very heaven on earth and where lies the city Dhillika (Delhi), built by the Tomaras. This agrees with the Palam Baoli Inscription of the time of Balban (A.D. 1280) which provides its variant name Hariyanaka.

            Haryana is the cradle of Indian culture, and also the traditional battlefield where many a time the fate of India was decided. To understand this one has also to take into account the geopolitical background which has greatly stimulated its historical and cultural growth. Bounded in the north by the Himalayas, in the south by the Aravallis and in the west by the great desert of Rajasthan, the region has always been considered a gateway to the plains of Northern India. To this strategical importance was added the economic prosperity mainly due to its river beds—the Sarasvati, the Drishadvatiand the Yamuna with their numerous feeders.

            Archaeological explorations in Haryana began more than a century ago with the efforts of Sir Alexander Cunningham and Rodgers and were later followed by
            D.B. Spooner and others. These attempts, though pioneering were mainly exploratory and largely confined to the historical period, hence "their full import could not be understood for want of scientific technique and advanced archaeological knowledge." B.B. Lal was the first to bring to the light archaeological evidence for the pre-Budha history of the region with his discovery of the Painted Grey Ware, a proto-historic ceramic industry of the first half of the first millennium B.C. at Kurukshetra, Pehowa, Amin, Panipat, etc. He has associated this pottery with the Aryans of the Mahabharata period. The discovery of stone age tools from Pinjor and Chandigarh further suggests the hoary antiquity of the human habitation in this region.
            Proper exploration and excavation of the region were undertaken for the first time by the Department of Ancient Indian History, Culture, and Archaeology, Kurukshetra University, Kurukshetra. Udai Vir Singh, in collaboration with Suraj Bhan, conducted excavations at Daulatpur, Karan-Ka-Qila, and Mirzapur. Suraj Bhan started an exploration of the region in 1961 and discovered as many as two hundred archaeological sites. He conducted independent excavations at Sugh (1964-65), Mitathal (1968), and Siswal(1970), and worked on pre-historical archaeology of Sarasvati and Drishadvati valleys. Jointly with Jim. G. Shaffer conducted an extensive archaeological survey in northern Haryana bringing to light several pre-Harappan, Harappan, Late-Harappan, PGW, historical and medieval sites. The Banawali excavation, conducted by
            R.S. Bisht of the Department of Archaeology, Haryana, has brought to light one of the most important town sites of pre-Harappan and Harappan cultures in the region, while at Bhagwanpura excavation J.P. Joshi of the ArchaeologicalSurvey of India, adduced for the first time, evidence of overlap between the Late-Harappans and the Painted Grey Ware Culture, a discovery of considerable significance for the early cultural and historical study of the region.
            These archaeological discoveries prove beyond doubt that the region was inhabited from very early times and was the center of vigorous cultural and political activity. It perhaps holds the key to some of the fundamental questions of our early history and archaeology.
            The Shiwalik foot hills and possibly also the region around the Aravallis present a clue to the earliest inhabitants of Haryana who were primitive people using stone tools, while the settlements found at Siswal and Mitathal, and Banawali provide the earliest phases of its proto-history. These latter settlers who are called Pre-Harappans lived in the chalcolithic stage (C.2300 B. C.-2000 B.C.). of culture. They built houses of mud or sun-dried bricks or huts of reeds plastered with clay, knew the cultivation of cereals, and domesticated bull and goat. They decorated themselves with objects of gold, copper, clay, and semi-precious stones. They used wheel-made red ware painted in black and decorated with incised designs both on the interior and exterior. It has been suggested that the close affinities of the culture with Kalibangam or Sothi culture of North Rajasthan, the proximity of the region of its provenance to North Rajasthan, and a more evolved character of the culture in Haryana (as seen in Siswal and Mitathal ) points to North Rajasthan as the source of the culture."

            The Harappans (2000 B. C.-1000 B.C.).The most prominent Harappan sites in the region are Mitathal, Rakhigarhi, and Banawali. The existence of twin mounds at these sites suggests that the Harappans followed the typical pattern of the well-known classical sites of the Harappan culture. A clay seal bearing the characteristic Harappan script has been recovered from Rakhigarhi. However, certain other features mark the regional character (with closer affinities with North Rajasthan than the Indus Valley ) of the Harappan civilization in the region. The settlers seem to have migrated to Haryana as colonizers probably from North Rajasthan.

            "The far fewer Harappan sites and the dominating character of their towns as compared to the numerous pre-Harappan chalcolithic villages, the super-imposition of the latter sites by the former at Mitathal, etc. and the co-existence of the two at several sites perhaps do not rule out the possibility of a political bias in the expansion of the Harappans in this region".
            The next phase is called the late-Harappan culture (C. 1700 B.C.-1500 B.C.) representing the decadent phase of the Harappan Civilization. It was discovered at Mitathal which provided for the first time clear stratigraphic evidence of the survival of the Harappan culture in North India. The material equipment of this phase as found at Mitathal (period II B) and Daulatpur (period I) excavations suggest a degenerated stage as indicated by the evolved shapes, inferior treatment of the surface, and the simpler and fewer decoration in the pottery. The remains of oval ovens, charred grains, grinding stones along with copper fish hooks, and bone points at Daulatpur suggest that hunting and fishing supplemented the food supply of the people. The people decorated their persons with ornaments like bangles of faience and beads terracotta and semi-precious stones. At Mitathal was discovered a copper harpoon, ring, and axe (parshu), all typical of the well-known 'Copper Hoards' and a Neolithic ring stone is significant for providing for the first time late-Harappan context for the Copper Hoards. The changed
            ecological conditions might have led the Harappan to adopt new tool-types imitations of the Neolithic people. This process of assimilation of the two cultures led to the evolution of a composite culture in the region, which later on extended farther east into the Ganga-Yamuna Doab providing for the first time cultural unity to the ancient Madhyadesha.

            Towards the beginning of the first millennium B.C. with the advent of the Painted Grey Ware (PGW) culture, a new era dawned upon Haryana. PGW has been traced from a large number of sites in Haryana, especially in the Kurukshetra region. It has been recovered from several sites mentioned in the later Vedic literature and is associated with the Mahabharata period. "The preponderance of the ware in the Sarasvati and the Drishadvati Valleys, its chronological position in the first half of the first millennium B.C. and its occurrence at sites alluded to in the later Vedic and Sutra literature might indicate the association of the PGW culture with the Later Vedic and the Sutra Age". For a long, scholars were puzzled over the clear breach between the Harappans and the Aryans but the excavations at Bhagwanpur (District Kurukshetra) have brought to light for the first time the juxtaposition of the Late-Harappans and the PGW culture as reflected in the continuity of pottery-types in painted designs, and the terracotta figurines and burials.

            The advent of the Bharatas, the most powerful Aryan tribe of the Rigvedic period, makes the history of the region coherent and meaningful. Settled between the Sarasvati and the Yamuna, the Bharatas (after whom the country was called Bharata) were the earliest inhabitants of the region of whom we have any written record. Their King Divodasa vanquished the Purus, the Yadus, the Turvasa, Shambara, the dasa king, and the Panis; and also encountered the Paravatas and the Brishayas on the bank of the Sarasvati. But the most striking event is the battle that was waged between Sudasa (Bharata ) and a confederacy of ten kings. It was a
            continuation of a struggle for supremacy that began in the time of Sudasa's predecessor Divodasa. The immediate cause of the battle was the dismissal of Vishvamitra (a priest) by Sudasa who appointed a new priest Vasishtha, reputed for his learning. In the battle of Parushni (Ravi ), the Bharatas emerged victorious under Sudasa's leadership defeating the formidable enemies led by the Purus. He waged another battle on the bank of the Yamuna defeating a few other non-Aryan tribes.

        <p class="content">
            The Bharatas, who defeated a confederacy of kings, were well versed in military warfare. They worshipped nature and encouraged learning. The glory of the Bharatas finds a special mention in the Mahabharata and Bhasa's famous play The Svapnavasavadattam. "The greatness of Bharata', says the Shatapatha, "neither the men before nor those after him attained, nor did the five (tribes of )men, even as a mortal does not touch the sky with his arms."

            The extreme north-west of India was subjected to Persian rule under Cyrus (558-529 B.C.), Darius (528-486 B.C.), and Xerxes (486-465 B.C.). Xerxes's successors proved weak-lings and lost their hold over Indian possessions when their hegemony was completely shattered by Alexander in 330 B.C. From classical accounts, it is gathered that Indians enjoyed the confidence of the Persian sovereign and also the distinction of protecting him in their fight against the Greeks. Probably the Indian contingent which fought the Greeks included soldiers of the Kuru realm well-known for their valor.

            The past centuries have seen the first attempt in history at the conquest of India by a western power, when Alexander the Great briefly led his army into the Indus Valley, in 327 BCE. This episode was quickly followed by the rise of the first great empire in ancient India, that of the Maurya. At its height, this empire covered most of the sub-continent along with haryana, together with neighboring regions in central Asia. Its most notable ruler was the devout Buddhist king, Ashoka (also spelled Asoka - reigned 268-241 BCE), one of the most remarkable figures in world history. He sought to apply his faith to ruling his vast territories.

            Since Ashoka's death, the Mauryan empire has gone into decline, and will shortly fragment into many independent states. By that time, however, the Aryan civilization will have become firmly established in central India, and soon the first large regional state will appear there. To the north-west, the presence of the Greek-ruled kingdom of Bactria is a conduit for western influences upon Indian civilization, and vice versa.

        <p class="content">
            After the fall of the Maurayas, the region also suffered due to the invasions of Bactrian Greeks. These invasions are
            mentioned, in the Patanjala Mahabhashya, Kalidasa's play Malvikagnimitra, and the Gargisamhita. This was just a passing phase. The Buddhist work Divyavadana and the other finds of this period suggest that the Sungas maintained some hold, if not their direct rule over the region. The Manavadharmashastra which was written sometime during the Sunga period considers the region's standards of piety and good conduct as ideal, and worthy of emulation by the entire humanity.
            The end of Pushyamitra Sunga's rule marks the rise of republican people-the Agras and the Yaudheyas, whose coins, seals, and sealings are recovered at various places in Haryana. The Agra or Agratyas admittedly settled in the area covering Agroha, Banawali, and Aurangabad, as is evident from the discovery of coins mostly of copper at these places. The earliest Yaudheya coins in this region were found at Khokrakot, Aurangabad, Hansi, Hisar, Bhiwani, and Behat, which show their extensive
            territory. Quite interestingly these coins refer to the title of their rulers, the name of the people, and their land which was known as Bahudhana or Bahudhanyaka (i.e. of plenty of corn). The Yaudheyas ruled over the region of Haryana till they were conquered by the Indo-Greeks towards the end of the 2nd century B.C. or at the beginning of the Ist century B.C..

            A large find of coins of kings from Heliocles to Hermaeous was discovered some years ago at Sonipat; and no less than 703 specimens have been weighed by Gen. Cunningham, who has acutely suggested that the order of the reigns may be gathered by a consideration of the amount of weight lost in circulation by the coins of different kings, those kings whose coins are most worn being naturally supposed to be the earliest. The loss is as follows:- <br>
            Heliocles, 5.43 gr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philoxenus, 3.77 gr.
            <br>
            Apollodotus, 4.57 gr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Menander, 3.72 gr.
            <br>
            Strato, 4.56 gr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diomedes, 3.39 gr.
            <br>
            Antimachus II., 4.48 gr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amyntas, 3.30 gr.
            <br>
            Antialcidas, 4.10 gr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hermaeus, 3.20 gr.
            <br>
            In this calculation, it is assumed that the normal standard for hemidrachms is 37 grains and that all kings minted up to that standard. This is, of course, not certain; nevertheless, the results of the test so nearly agree with the testimony of style, that we can scarcely be wrong in regarding the above order as approximately correct; only Antialcidas and Lysias should not be placed so late.

            Among all these kings, two only, Apollodotus and Menander, are known to us from other sources. Menander is identified with the Milinda of the Buddhist work "Milinda-prasna," which records not only that he was born in the sub-Caucasian Alexandria, but that he was a just and powerful ruler and a convert to the Buddhist religion. The extraordinary abundance and wide distribution of his silver coins are well known. They were current, with those of Apollodotus, at Bary-Gaza, many years after his death, and are still abundantly found over a wide region, including Kabul, Jalalabad, Peshawar, Mathura, and Rampur. They are not brought from Kandahar or Seistan.

            Greek rule in India was eroded by three groups of invaders - the Yueh Chih, Scythians, and Parthians. After driving away the Greeks from Bactria in about 130 BCE, the Yueh-chihs drove them away from Kabul also in about 70 BCE. The Scythians captured Taxila from the Greeks in about 90-80 BCE. Though the Indo-Greeks recovered back their rule in Gandhara and western Punjab was completely replaced by the Scythians in c. 55 BCE. Even after this, the Greek rule was preserved over a small area in eastern Punjab till about 10 CE until they were finally conquered by the Scythians. Thus the Greek rule in India came to an end.
